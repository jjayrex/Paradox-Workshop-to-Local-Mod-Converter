# Paradox Workshop to Local Mod Converter
This small "application" will batch convert workshop mods to work as local for Paradox games.

**Should work for all games running on the Clausewitz Engine.**

**How to use:**
1. Copy all the mod folders from the steam workshop directory to a separate folder.
2. Put the *paradox-mod-converter.exe* next to these folders.
3. Run it

I primarily made this for my friends, because they own Crusader Kings 3 on GamePass, and as such cannot access Steam Workshop. Therefore it's not exactly anything even slightly advanced. I might expand it in the future.
